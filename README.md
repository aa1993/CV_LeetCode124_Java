## Description

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.

**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range $`[1, 3 * 10^4]`$.
`-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
